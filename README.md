# WellUI
Good Day to you - dear js-developer friend!  I want to present you my useful library. 
It is a tiny library, with vanilla-JS methods, that makes work of javascript-developers a little bit easier.
<i>There is no jQuery or others deendency libs. Only pure javascript.</i>

The library has their own fadeIn, fadeOut, Parent search by a class,
mix of forEach and EventHandler (can be aplied for one or more events),
selecting and create array from collection for easier iterate, and many other interesting and usefull methods.

Only 14 kb in uncompressed style and 4 kb in compressed.

To use it, you just need to include a library file in to your web-page.
